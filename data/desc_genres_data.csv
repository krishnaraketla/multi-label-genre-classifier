"From New York Times bestselling author, David Morrell, comes a classic thriller that introduced the character of Rambo, one of the most iconic action heroes of the twentieth century. 

Called “the father of the modern action novel,” FIRST BLOOD changed the genre. Although the book and the film adaptation have similarities, they are very different, especially its unexpected ending and its greater intensity. If you’ve only experienced the film, you’re in for a surprise.

Once they were soldiers. Rambo, the ragged kid whose presence in town is considered a threat. And Teasle, the Chief of Police of Madison, Kentucky. Both have been trained to kill: Rambo in Vietnam, Teasle in Korea. They learned different military tactics, different ways of death and survival in two different wars.

Now, without warning, they are enemies in a civilian combat that becomes a chase through the woods and mountains and caves above the town. As we follow them, we understand that once a man has been trained as a killer, perhaps he is changed forever.

Award-winning FIRST BLOOD was published in 1972, was translated into 26 languages, and has never been out of print. It was one of the first novels to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder.

David’s novelizations for RAMBO (FIRST BLOOD PART II) and RAMBO III are available as e-books. They’re quite different from the films and include revealing introductions. See also David’s RAMBO AND ME: THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY.

"Siobhan Dunmoore was not having a good war. 

She's had more ships shot out from under her by the invading Shrehari Empire than any other officer in the Fleet. Some called her overly aggressive. Others simply called her reckless. What the enemy called her was something else altogether.  That she gave the Shrehari a good drubbing along the way didn't matter in the least, because not all her enemies wore an Imperial uniform. A reputation for bad luck was pretty much the only reputation she had left.

Sailing yet another ruined starship home after a near defeat, she wanted nothing more than a long, long rest, because this time, she had escaped by the thinnest of bluffs. Unfortunately, the Admiralty had other ideas.

The frigate Stingray was known as the unluckiest ship in the Fleet and her Captain had just been removed in disgrace for cowardice. Some in the Admiralty would dearly love to retire the old warhorse. After all, she was the last of her type left in service, and perhaps it was time to break up the jinx permanently, along with the crew. But in the midst of an interstellar war, every ship that could fight was needed.

In short order, Dunmoore went from staring down the Empire's finest on the bridge of a wrecked battleship to taking on a demoralized, semi-mutinous crew, scheming Admirals and a deadly mystery. Stingray's bad luck wasn't just superstition gone rampant. Between a crew that won't talk, political enemies who want her gone, and her personal demons, she's got her hands full. Taking the frigate into battle under those conditions would seem foolish to anyone else, but Dunmoore was never one to shrink from a good fight. Failure was not an option, and defeat not an acceptable alternative, for there was no honor in death, only in victory.  She would redeem herself and her ship or be damned for all eternity.","84, 30, 1, 176, 175, 33, 86, 1, 89"

"In The Durable & Damned, Brandon LaMarr skillfully blends historical reimagination with dystopian science fiction. Set in a world where Basque speakers and rulers dominated colonialism, the story takes place six generations after a devastating world war. This richly built universe sees the privileged few controlling advanced technology, while the majority, including the Kudumu—descendants of the African diaspora—struggle against systemic oppression.

Through the journal entries of Baqee, a young Kudumu, readers are drawn into a society governed by an all-powerful algorithmic machine. This machine, updated by the ruling Basque-speaking class, enforces a rigid status quo, perpetuating disparities that have existed for centuries. Baqee's narrative captures the essence of survival, resilience, and the quest for justice in a world mirroring our own societal inequities.

Baqee's journey reveals the fluid realities faced by the Kudumu, reflecting the experiences of the African diaspora. He navigates a life filled with labor, supervision by the privileged Mdudu, and the constant shadow of societal control. His hopes and dreams reveal the varied responses of his people—from rebellion to assimilation, from acceptance to a deep reverence for their cultural roots. The Kudumu's diverse heritage is showcased through a blend of languages, including English, Swahili, and Haitian Creole.

The Durable & Damned shares themes with the works of Richard Wright and Octavia Butler, particularly the exploration of racial injustice, societal survival, and complex power dynamics. Like Wright's Native Son and Butler's Parable of the Sower, LaMarr's narrative is a powerful commentary on the enduring struggle for equity and the resilience of the human spirit.

This novel is not just a story; it's a reflection on history, an exploration of futuristic possibilities, and a critique of ongoing societal issues. The Durable & Damned challenges readers to reflect on the past and imagine a future where justice and equality are attainable. Immerse yourself in the journey of Baqee and the Kudumu—a story of resilience, struggle, and the fluid realities of survival and hope.","84, 2, 86, 17, 91, 17, 86"

"This novel intertwines religions, spirituality, and philosophy.

Dear reader, regardless of your belief, religion, culture, or even if you are secular, I promise you that you will be astonished by this novel, and your life will change after reading it. I promise that its details will remain etched in your memory for life. I also promise that the name Lilith will be forever engraved in your mind.

Dear reader,

Welcome to the pages of this novel, which represents a deep personal and intellectual journey for me. It is among the latest and finest work I have ever written. As you delve into the strange and mysterious realms of this story, I would like to share a secret that may seem unfamiliar but is profoundly meaningful to me.

This novel was the result of mysterious flows of inspiration; it was not merely a product of my conscious mind, but rather ideas flowed into my mind as if sent from a supernatural world, from a hidden place whose source I do not know. During the writing process, I felt as though I was merely a conduit for visions and concepts that transcended the limits of my knowledge and understanding of the world.

This hidden inspiration led me to construct parallel worlds where lost souls meet and nightmares become tangible realities. The worlds you will read about here may be more than mere fiction; they are a reflection of a truth that might exist within the folds of the universe, beyond the scope of our ordinary vision.

I invite you to open your heart and mind as you read, to experience this spiritual and intellectual journey with me, and to allow yourself to question the source of creativity and whether there are hidden forces guiding us toward discovering deeper truths about our existence. Perhaps, within these pages, you too may find a glimmer of inspiration that transcends the boundaries of this world.

I wish you an enjoyable journey filled with reflection and inquiry.

With warm regards,

"With the release of the First Edition of Caesar Triumphant in 2013, which is set ten years after the fateful Ides of March in 44 BCE, readers were introduced to an alternate history in which Julius Caesar heeds the warning of The Seer. 

After Caesar and his Legions conquered the vast expanse of Parthia, they invaded India as part of Caesar’s ambition to outstrip the exploits of the Macedonian king Alexander. Then, they traversed Asia to reach the fabled end of the world known as the Isle of Wa, modern-day Japan, the invasion of which is the subject of Caesar Triumphant. 

Caesar Triumphant became a bestseller, and readers were engaged enough that it spawned the six-volume Caesar Ascending series, which covers the ten-year period prior to Caesar Triumphant, beginning with Caesar Ascending-Invasion of Parthia. 

While the Second Edition of Caesar Triumphant contains the engaging and exciting battle scenes originally released with the First Edition that made it a bestseller, it has been updated to include the storylines of several characters readers were introduced to over the previous six volumes of Caesar Ascending, and is now divided into two parts to accommodate these new subplots and resolutions, while Part Two (coming in January of 2022) contains a new Epilogue  that hints at what the ancient world may have looked like if Caesar had heeded the warning, “Beware The Ides of March”.","84, 3, 17, 126"
"From her first appearance in Grantville Gazette 4, no one viewed Velma Hardesty as a delicate flower, with one exception. Virginia DeMarce's ""A Rose By Any Other Song"" ends Velma's tale from the point of view of that person 

Natalie Silk's tale tells how Rahel's life goes ""Down This Path"" to a childbirth that takes her life in an unanticipated direction.. 

In other news, George Grant's ""Mail From Up-Time"" sees the consequence of some set-aside and forgotten mail being delivered in Grantville. George then gives us our first flash fiction in ""The Small Crisis."" 

Sometimes, in this vast universe, we miss steps in explaining how things develop. Marc Tyrrell fills in some gaps on early military intelligence in ""Making Hay While the Sun Shines."" 

Every now and then, all the early readers instantly love a story. Bob Finegold's ""Among the Faithful"" is one of those rare gems. Freedom of religion and tolerance were seismic changes. This is the story of one town struggling to adapt after Krystalnacht.

"On January 6, 2021, over 100,000 people showed up at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., to attend President Trump's ""Stop the Steal"" rally. For four hours, the crowd was whipped into a frenzy by speakers' exhortations to ""Never give up! Never conceded!""

The President of the United States brought the rally on the Ellipse to a close with these words, ""Something's wrong here. Something's really wrong. Can't have happened…we fight. We fight like Hell and if you don't fight like Hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.""

Minutes later, a mob of Trump's supporters attacked the United States Capitol Building to prevent the joint session of Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes. The rioters assaulted Capitol Police officers and, within an hour, had broken through the police lines protecting several of the building's entrances. Over two thousand insurrectionists swarmed inside, vandalizing and looting the House and Senate Chambers, the National Statuary Hall, and Congressional offices, including the office of Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi.

As rioters ransacked the Capitol, they searched for, called out, and threatened many lawmakers by name. They even erected a gallows on the lawn west of the Capitol Building.

At 2:24 p.m., the President tweeted:

Mike Pence didn't have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!

Upon seeing the President's tweet, the mob inside the Capitol Building took up the chant, ""Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence! Hang Mike Pence!""

"""The Last Independence Day: Secession"" explores secession in the modern era, capturing the tumultuous collapse of the United States political order. The narrative gains an intense turn as domestic terrorists launch a catastrophic attack against the US Capitol, assassinating the nation's leadership. This act of terror exacerbates the political crisis, deepening the divide and chaos.

Central to the story is Jon Freeman, an apolitical lawyer who becomes entangled in these extraordinary events. Following the 2022 midterm elections, Arkansas, along with other red states, morphs into a stronghold of right-wing extremism. Extremist politicians created the Red State Compact, with Arkansas at its forefront, passing the oppressive ""New Law"" that strips away civil rights, plunging the red states into a dystopian nightmare.

Freeman's odyssey is that of an unanticipated hero, propelled into a battle against the ""New Law"" and the radical political landscape. His adversary is the formidable Arkansas Governor Suzy Brandy 'Buckshot' Landers, the face of the new authoritarian regime. The narrative weaves Freeman's efforts to deal with the secession of several states, fight a growing rebellion, and prevent an impending civil war. His journey is a test of his bravery and a reflection of his deep-seated commitment to his nation and state, now at the brink of fragmentation and conflict.","84, 3, 30, 33, 86, 32, 182"

This is a collection of previously released steamy short contemporary romances, complete with instalove and a guaranteed happily-ever-afters. If you're looking for a great lunchtime read, or something to spark sexy dreams before bed, you'll want to pick these up.

Round Up
Corey: Dawn's been my best friend since high school, the one constant in my life, and the only woman I've ever been myself with. She's also way out of my league, but I've realized over the last few weeks I love her. And while I don't want to lose our friendship, no other woman will ever come close, and I'll never be all in on a relationship while the what-if with Dawn hangs over my head. So I have to deal with the what-if.

Dawn: I've loved Corey since the ninth grade, only he's never thought of me that way. To him I'm one of the boys, and never one of the many bleach blonde bimbos he takes home from the bar… which is fine. I resigned to being his best friend, and nothing more, a long time ago. But now he's back after taking off for a few weeks—no note, no call, no text—and he's acting weird. Really weird.

Making Up
Max: We have a code word at The Last Stand Saloon—Red Sonja—and the guys know to send up the alert on any six foot tall redhead that enters my bar. Only this time when they call it, I'm not expecting the woman who broke my heart to walk in eight months pregnant with divorce paperwork in hand. Yes, we had an arrangement that did not include forever, but I mean to change her mind.

Sonja: I didn't mean to bring this—motions to very round belly—to Max's door, but he refuses to sign the divorce paperwork and we have to settle this prior to the big day. We had an agreement, and he never wanted a girlfriend, much less a wife, anyway. So, even though I loved him long before I wrangled him into this farce of a marriage, why won't he let me let him off the hook?

Cowboy Up
Troy: I did a damn good job of falling into obscurity two years ago, so I can't believe, of all the women to walk into the Last Stand Saloon, that it's her. I don't believe in coincidences, but I do believe in fate. And what could be more fated than the woman of my dreams walking into the one place outside of the rodeo circuit that has ever felt like home to me?

AnnaRose: He disappeared two years ago—not just from my life, but from everything and everyone. So when I showed up at a client's location, I had no idea he'd be here—and my professional bull rider wants to pick up where we left off, starting with a date. He already broke my heart once. Can I trust him not to do it again?

Giddy Up
Denny: I would never pick up a chick at the bar I manage security at, but it's my night off and I have nowhere else to go. So when a woman I've never seen before throws me eyes from across the dance floor, I have to at least buy her a drink. Could I really meet my angel in this place?

Vivi: This is my first child free weekend in over four years—my first chance to cut loose, drink, and dance my cares away—and although my friend is hell-bent on finding me a man, I refuse to believe the hot and broody bear of a man across the room could be interested in my mom bod.","84, 4, 29, 86, 112, 37"

"Four humorous, heartbreaking tales of New Yorkers in the arts, gay and straight, frustrated in the pursuit of love and their precarious careers, set in that almost forgotten world before the deluge of smart phones and social media changed forever how we navigate relationships and work.

Reviews of Floating World: Tales of Unrequited Love in '90s New York 

""Brilliant, touching portraits: A sharply comic look at bewildered 30-somethings frustrated by love and sex and searching for meaning in their lives and careers. The intricate plotting and rich writing reward multiple readings."" 

""These stories are beautiful: Evocative, touching and funny at times, the stories catch life midstream - with all the rough edges, memories, dreams, worries and physical discomforts that implies. The collection delivers even more in the second reading. One drops into this world and bathes in the poetic language and the poignancy and complexity inherent in relationships.""

""Seeing into Love (and Life): The four stories in this collection by Frank Pike are exquisite—lyrical but strong, fine jewels but not delicate, certainly not breakable, each with its own big emotional punch. I remember The Two Waynes when it was first published; I have that issue of Boulevard Magazine on the bookshelf in my study. Reading it again now is an experience deeply etched with nostalgia. Assumption was also published in Boulevard -- a beauty I hadn't read before. The other two are gorgeous as well; I hardly breathed from beginning to end. The careful accrual of Pike's images tricks you into reading for the beauty of the words -- like Wordsworth's ""Tintern Abbey"" or Hopkins' ""The Windhover"" (I had to look them up to remember why those English major delights were occurring to me reading Pike's stories)--and then realizing that the stories really are ""seeing into the life of things"". And deeply. In other words, they are not about remembered pleasure, not about chagrin, but about deep loss and sadness. So glad the stories are together now in this readable, shareable form!""

""Beautiful and Poignant: I was enchanted by the stories in Floating World. I was especially taken with ""The Two Waynes"" and ""Assumption."" I thought the characters were beautifully drawn, and I found all of the stories to be poignant. Beautiful prose. I have always loved short fiction, and these stories reminded me why.""

""Keenly observed. Richly detailed.""

""A Great Read! Funny. Sad. Wonderful language.""

"At first glance, Phil Pendleton and his son Adam are just an ordinary father and son, no different from any other. They take walks in the park together, visit county fairs, museums, and zoos, and eat overlooking the lake. Some might say the father is a little too accommodating given the lack of discipline when the child loses his temper in public. Some might say he spoils his son by allowing him to set his own bedtimes and eat candy whenever he wants. Some might say that such leniency is starting to take its toll on the father, given how his health has declined.

What no one knows is that Phil is a prisoner, and that up until a few weeks ago and a chance encounter at a grocery store, he had never seen the child before in his life.

"Australian history is replete with drama, yet for many, Australia’s history from 1788 only consists of indigenous dispossession, convicts, gold-rushes, bushrangers and ANZACs. This book proves this view wrong — sure, we do include the old favourites – but there are many other tales to intrigue you. There’s the custom official with the ingenious way of detecting illegal immigrants, the escapee who enjoys the taste of homo-sapiens, a colonial governor with a penchant for practical jokes, an evil military secret and an insider’s view of a female mental asylum. Showcased here are thirty-three award-winning stories from Australian history, all based on real events, that shine a light on some of the lesser known corners of our past.

“Drop your breeches. There’s a good lad.” The ship’s medical officer barely looks at me. He has his back to me while he waits for me to oblige. A small mallet twirls in his fingers. I dunno what he thinks he’s going to do with that. “Strip, lad. That’s an order. What’s your name?” 
“It’s…” 
I can’t answer. Of all the ridiculous things I’ve failed at, forgetting to have a name is by far the most stupid.

My eardrums shudder. The door erupts. A bag of flour flies across the room filling it with white fog. Noise reverberates around my skull, shatters the window. After the blast there is silence. For a few seconds I think I’m deaf. Then a thin wail pierces the paralysis; screams, thudding footsteps, shocked voices and the high-pitched terror of horses overwhelm the settlement.

"The Kokinshu, compiled around 905 C.E. in 20 thematic books, was the first imperial anthology of Japanese poetry. It defined the acceptable topics, diction, imagery, and style of court poetry for the next thousand years. Haiku poets took many cues from this tradition, including giving primacy to seasonal imagery.

Ice Melts in the Wind is an exciting new translation of the six books of seasonal poems, depicting the progression from New Year’s Day through spring cherry blossoms and summer cuckoo songs to autumn’s colorful leaves and winter snow, ending again with the New Year. Japanese text and commentary is included for every poem, along with brief biographies of all named poets.
