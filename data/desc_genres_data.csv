"When Samantha's pharmaceutical company is threatened, there's nothing she won't do as CEO to save it. That includes stealing a drug formula from the Spectrum Institute, and selling it as her own.

She's certain that her newer formula is more effective, but she needs a test subject to confirm. Someone within her control, and loyal. She thought she'd found that with Richard, an ex-military security guard on her staff. But his hot, hungry glances and constant insubordination are driving her to distraction, in more ways than one.

When Samantha realizes the drug has unintended side effects, sending its subjects into primal frenzies, she doesn't want to believe it. She can't afford to. Then, a primal regression strikes Richard. Not only is she begging him to take her, but she learns just how intoxicating a regression can be.","84, 29"

"Donna talks to the waitresses down at le Panorama and starts to plan what she and the customer rep's wife might wear to supper.
I manage to talk to the customer rep on the telephone.
The customer rep asks me, “Is le Panorama some kind of sleazy place that will turn my wife off?  I have enough problems with her right now and I certainly don't need any more problems.” 
I lecture him, “The place is a really nice restaurant.  The food is good, the service is good.  The waitresses are young, attractive and they work topless.  However, they're waitresses, not whores.  They smile, take orders, serve the food and do what any other waitress in a high class restaurant does, only they do it topless.”
The customer rep asks, “Then, you have been to the place?”
“Yes, I took my wife and we had supper there, in order to know what to expect.  I like the place.  My wife liked the place, but she was a little worried that I might be distracted by the topless waitresses.  She took steps to make sure that I remembered that she was still my lady, once we got home.”  (This last is called, in the business world, puttin' in the old hookaroo!)
The customer rep says, “Look, Gary, I need this topless restaurant thing to work.  How do we make sure it works?”  (Once the customer rep starts to call me by my first name, I have him hooked.  Now it's just a matter of hooking his wife as well!)
“George, the ladies who go to the restaurant have a sort of style of their own.  They're not topless, but they maybe show a bit more than they would at another place.  Far be it for me to tell a lady how to dress for an evening out.  However, my wife needs to talk to your wife.  Donna can kind of ease Corrine into the idea of le Panorama and what a lady needs to wear there, given what the other ladies there are wearing.”
George says, “It does sound like a good idea for your wife to talk to my wife.  However, Donna does need to be very careful here.”
“George, my wife was a bit skittish about going to le Panorama.  However, she went and saw how it words, for herself.  Donna will know what your wife's fears are, before we visit the restaurant and she'll be able to talk to Corrine, woman to woman, to prepare your wife for her first visit to le Panorama.  Since it'll be Corrine's first visit to a topless place, some preparation will work very well here.”
George says, “Okay, I'll have Corrine call Donna.  It sounds like the way to go.  However, Donna needs to remember that around our home area, things are rather conservative and Corrine is a bit worried, maybe more than just a bit worried.”
“George, leave it to Donna.  I have known Donna since we were in school together and Donna is pretty conservative for our area.  Donna isn't some kind of wild child, she's the kind of woman who can talk to your wife.  If Corrine talks to Donna, I'm sure that Corrine will come out here ready to at least try le Panorama.  If Corrine tries le Panorama, I'm sure she'll have much the same reaction that Donna did and your problems should be over.”
George then asks, “By the way, what do I wear?”
“The same thing that you would wear to any other fancy restaurant.  Definitely a jacket, however, a tie isn't required.  One other thing, our waitress will be very friendly to you.  She's being paid to be so friendly.  The idea is to make your wife a bit jealous.  However, absolutely no touching!  Also staring isn't the way to go, although it won't get you thrown out.”
George says, “Right!  I have your home phone and I'll have Corrine call Donna.”
“Sounds good.  Donna and I can't wait to see you and your wife.”
Afterward, I talk with Donna.  I tell her, “You need to do your very best here.  If we can cure George, the customer rep's problem, I'll get a nice promotion and we’ll get a raise in pay.”
Donna says, “As long as you remember it's we curing George's problem.”
“Donna, we need to work as a team, always!”","84, 29, 112"

When Ava Marley stumbles upon the mysterious Atlas Hotel on a remote beach in Zanzibar, she's already on the run.

Operation Iraqi Freedom's failure to reveal WMDs was no error but a massive cover-up. An Australian SAS report exposed on Wikileaks suggests Saddam's arms were moved to Syria. And a senior Coalition officer looks to have been complicit.

Did the U.S. allow Saddam's weapons to slip away? Could the sarin being used by Syria today in its civil war actually be Saddam's? And what's the anonymous whistleblower's enigmatic agenda?

"The relentless ticking of the clock echoed through the tense silence as four elite Special Forces teams raced against time to locate and rescue a highly valuable prisoner of war. Captain James Rodriguez of Team Alpha gripped the stock of his assault rifle, sweat beading on his brow as his squad hacked through the dense jungle undergrowth. Their target: an underground bunker where the POW was rumored to be held. 

Miles away, Lieutenant Emily Thompson led Team Bravo up the treacherous mountain peaks, her ice axe biting into the frozen rock as they closed in on a remote enemy stronghold. Using advanced thermal imaging, they scouted for signs of the captive, the biting winds whipping their combat gear.

In the blistering desert expanse, Sergeant Miguel Ramirez rallied Team Charlie, their tan combat fatigues blending with the golden sands. Intelligence suggested the prisoner was inside a fortified compound, its walls lined with hostile forces ready to unleash hell. 

And near the pounding surf, Major David Reynolds commanded Team Delta, expertly slipping past the perimeter guards of a coastal enemy camp. Their night vision goggles scanned the shadows as they searched building by building for the captured soldier.

The teams' radios crackled with encrypted updates - the POW was a high-value target, a Special Operations officer captured during a botched raid. He possessed critical intel that could shift the tides of the covert war they waged. Failure was not an option.

Adrenaline spiked as Team Alpha discovered a camouflaged entrance to the underground lair. With weapons raised, they descended into the blackness, following a maze of damp corridors to a heavy steel door. Explosive breaches blew it open, and they stormed the chamber - only to find it empty, save for bloodstains on the concrete floor.

Simultaneously, Team Bravo rappelled over the high walls of the mountain stronghold. Silenced gunfire and hand-to-hand combat ensued as they fought through the heavily guarded facility. But the prisoner had been moved, the cell empty and abandoned.

The desert sun seared as Team Charlie traded bullets with the enemy forces guarding the compound's entrance. Grenades detonated, shrapnel whizzing through the haze as they pushed forward with grim determination. Yet their target remained elusive.

It was Team Delta who finally struck gold. As they infiltrated the coastal encampment, night vision revealed a makeshift cell - and inside, the battered but alive POW. They swiftly cut him free and fought their way out under withering enemy fire. 

As the smoke cleared, the daring rescue was an against-all-odds success. But it had come at a steep cost - two team members critically wounded, the others bearing scars of the brutal battle. The POW himself was in dire condition from weeks of torture and interrogation.

On the long flight back to base, the grim-faced operators remained on high alert, knowing the enemy would soon be in pursuit. Captain Rodriguez looked at the faces of his brothers and sisters in arms and saw the strength that had carried them through hell. 

Once back on friendly soil, a grim debriefing followed as military intelligence hastily extracted the sensitive information from the liberated POW. The news was worse than anyone could have imagined - the enemy had a terrifying new bioweapon in development, one with the power to devastate the nation.","84, 1, 33, 86, 190"

"Winner of both the Hawthornden Prize and the James Tate Black Prize for Fiction, David Garnett's Lady Into Fox is the story of a man whose wife is turned into a fox. Need we say more? “At last, at last, the Hawthornden has chosen the right book.” – Virginia Woolf 

“The whole psychology of man and beast is, I should say, flawless, in essence and exposition.” – Joseph Conrad “It is as astonishing as a new sort of animal…suddenly running about in the world…as whimsically inevitable as a very healthy kitten. It shows up most other stories as the clockwork beasts they are.” – H.G. Wells, The Adelphi 

“It is one of the strangest little fictions in the English language. … Garnett's novella has attracted numerous readings: a political allegory about marriage, a fable about female sexuality, a coded love letter to Garnett's former lover, the painter Duncan Grant.” – Judith Mackrell, The Guardian 

“The story of Lady Into Fox is gripping and terrible…. What I love best about this story is its straight-faced, ever so slightly sly prose… The author uses humor, fantasy, allegory and realism to explore to explore pain, passion, conjugal fidelity, love, death and the whole damn thing.” – Andrew Barrow, Independent 

“Garnett’s story intimates that the sexual relation rests on the delusion that kin can be converted into kind. If the fable also applies to same-sex love (and I think it does), then perhaps Garnett’s point is darker still: every kind attempt we make to “claim kin” with one another is a sort of violence. Wild we begin toward one another—at day’s end, wild we remain.” – Maud Ellmann, Public Books

A beautiful and deadly albino, prized for his exotic looks as much as his skills in the shinobi arts. From a young age he finds himself shackled by the bonds of duty, forced into play as a sexual bargaining chip for the welfare of his shuudan.

Will love be sacrificed when duty and honor rule all? 

The life of a shinobi is, at its best, a selfless devotion to duty. In modern day Japan, the ninja legends live on in a grim saga of political maneuverings, betrayal, sexual abuse, torture and homoeroticism. 

The Shinobi clans lurk in the shadows, performing services that not even the hardened Yakuza will touch. Takahashi Yoshi fulfills his duty with soul-stripping resolve, each assignment driving a nail into a coffin of lost faith. After years of sexual abuse and torture in the name of clan honor, Yoshi must learn to trust, but the man who offers him hope is himself flawed. 

Sasaki Makoto has spent a career in torture and interrogation, exploring not only the dark secrets of his clan's enemies, but also the darkness within his own heart. 

How far must Yoshi run to escape his shame and torment? And what price freedom when fear and self-loathing threaten to upend the hard fought struggle to find meaning and safety in a world fraught with danger. 

Yoshi seeks time and space, only to find himself once more at the mercy of power mongers and despots. When Makoto finds him, Yoshi is broken in more than body. Near death, his spirit recedes to find safety within, locking out all who care. 

They say time will heal but the path to acceptance is never easy, the roadblocks many, and none will emerge unscathed as Yoshi embarks on a struggle for balance.

Shinobi is transgressive M/M literary fiction. It utilizes adult language and adult situations. It depicts violence, explicit sex and disturbing scenes/images. If you are offended by male/male eroticism, sexual situations, depiction of BDSM elements, and strong language you might not enjoy this work.

They were friends—just friends. Now they're something else entirely…

Jason

Maggie was my best friend's girl. When he died…I wasn't sure we'd get through it.

But we healed. Together. Maggie became my friend, my confidant, and my family. She's everything to me.

And I ruined it all last night.

One drunken night. That's all it took. Now I'm lost.

She deserves someone better than me.

Now, if I can't figure out how to go back to the way things were, I'll lose the most important relationship I have. The only one that truly matters.

Maggie

Last night, we shared tequila. I found myself hoping like I always do.

I'd replay last night a thousand times if I could. It's the morning after that needs erasing.

Our problem? His love for me isn't the more kind of love. He's made that abundantly clear. And that's okay. Some part of me knows Jason will always see me as his best friend's girl. 

I can't lose our friendship. If he wants to stay in the friend zone, I need to accept that. Move on. Rationally, I know this.

But convincing my heart…well, that's another story entirely.

Der sexy Erbe einer schottischen Anwalts-Dynastie ist nicht nur ein Workaholic, sondern hat eine ausgeprägte Schwäche für Oldtimer, Single Malts und Outdoor-Yoga. Die ersten Begegnungen mit Fotografin Luci hauen ihn buchstäblich um – auch dank des umwerfenden Charmes ihres riesigen Bloodhounds Drake.
Luci findet den smarten Anwalt zwar auch ziemlich heiß, doch glaubt sie nicht an eine gemeinsame Zukunft. Kann Ian sie davon überzeugen, dass Geld nicht zwangsläufig ein Charakterfehler ist und Hundesabber im Vintage-Porsche für ihn total in Ordnung geht?

Herzerwärmend, voller Humor und heiß, heiß, HEISS!

Ein Kurzroman über 180 Normseiten.

Leseprobe:
Es dauerte ungefähr fünf weitere Minuten, die sich wie eine Ewigkeit anfühlte, ehe endlich eine Reaktion kam: Ihr Telefon klingelte – ein Videoanruf von Ian. Kurz zögerte sie, ob sie darauf eingehen sollte, dann sprang sie wieder in ihr Bett, zog das Laken bis zum Hals und nahm das Gespräch an.
»Du hast wirklich einen sehr schrägen Sinn für Humor«, begann er ohne Vorgeplänkel und lachte übers ganze Gesicht. Luci liebte das Blitzen in seinen grünen Augen – und er hatte den Tag ganz offensichtlich in der Sonne verbracht, denn er hatte ordentlich Farbe abbekommen.
»Wieso?«, fragte sie betont unschuldig. »Nachdem du auf mein erstes Bild nicht reagiert hast, dachte ich, ich muss wohl einen Gang hochschalten und da Drake und du ja eine ganz besondere Verbindung miteinander habt, dachte ich ...«
»Dein erstes Bild ist der Wahnsinn – nur ein bisschen uneindeutig.«
»Du findest meinen Busen also uneindeutig?« Sie hatte ein Selfie von ihrem Oberkörper gemacht, ihm aber nur einen Makro-Ausschnitt davon geschickt. Darauf zu sehen war lediglich ein Hauch roter Spitze und ein wenig Haut. »Ich glaube, ich bin jetzt etwas beleidigt.« Sie zog einen Schmollmund.
»Dafür gibt's keinen Grund, es ist ein absolut fantastisches Foto – vor allem jetzt, wo ich weiß, was es zeigen soll.« Er zwinkerte ihr zu. »Aber dir ist schon klar, dass ich ein Mann bin und als solcher eher simpel gestrickt, nicht wahr? Insofern wäre etwas weniger Vergrößerung prima gewesen.«
»Du bist ein Mann und stehst auf ›etwas weniger Großes‹? Das finde ich jetzt schon ein wenig erschreckend ...« Sie sah ihn mit einem gespielt schockierten Gesichtsausdruck an. »Da habe ich mich wohl gewaltig in dir getäuscht.«","84, 35, 29, 112"

"LOGAN (Steele Protectors 1) is the 1st book in USA Today and Amazon #1 Bestselling Author, Carole Mortimer’s, BRAND NEW Contemporary Romantic Suspense series.

Author’s Note: Beware of the very sexy & very alpha Steele brothers. These books are HOT!

LOGAN Steele is having a bad day. Well…after being shot, and almost dying, he’s having a bad month. Being forced to recuperate by manning the offices at Steele Protectors, the family security company, is not improving his already short temper.

Which might be one explanation as to why Logan, after having a particularly difficult weekend, is so rude to the beautiful August Harvey when she is shown into his office one wet Monday afternoon.

The other reason could be that Logan is just naturally rude and impatient.

Nor is his mood improved by what August Harvey has to tell him.

August had thought she was doing the right thing by coming to see one of the Steele brothers when her friend Jenna disappears. But after only two minutes in the company of Logan Steele, August is seriously rethinking that decision. Logan might be one of the most dangerous and handsome men she has ever seen, and hotter than hell, but he’s also arrogant, rude, and just all-round impossible.

But there’s no denying that Jenna is missing, and the Steele brothers are the ones that need to find her. 

Being treated as if she might have had something to do with Jenna’s disappearances is the last thing August expected.

Until it’s revealed that she does…
