# multi-label-genre-classifier
This project focuses on developing a multi-label genre classifier using DistilBERT. The primary goal is to scrape book descriptions and genre labels from Smashwords.com and use this data to train a DistilBERT model that can accurately predict multiple genres for a given book description.
